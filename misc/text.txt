Timeline
Submission date: 9th Feburary
Need to update design system for the change in UI
ideally by 18th January by Hubob
need to code the software by end jan
take about 1-2 weeks to code out
finish the software on same day as the deadline for service design studio
Web experiment by 5th feb
4 days to evalutate study results
Jefferson will focus on sds before doing the software

Progress
Design system is finished
Need to finalise software user flow
Change of existing UI
New design to follow fathom software
Main issue with current UI is that the live updates of meeting minutes is very distracting
users will want to check if the auto filling is accurate

New UI design
New design is to not show the full meeting template during new meeting
maybe having buttons for users to track for action items during the meeting
press and hold
will be used to help the AI
current button choices are: action items, highlights, key dates and meeting details
When the meeting ends the full transcript and blocks will be compiled
if users never press the button its on them (not our problem)
concern that people usually only realise things are important after they have finished talking about it
pressing the button will retrieve information that was mention slightly b4 the button is pressed

Software Database
use a document database because data is not structured
use a noSQL database
either scyllaDB or mongoDB
Decided to do mongoDB because its alot easier and our use case isnt super complex
will setup as a docker container by morgan by wednesday

Service design studio
due next friday
Jefferson still need to code finish the chat feature
Gen AI stuff for chat is implemented in the backend already as an API
not integrated to the frontend yet
Jefferson can finish it by next monday
will prepare test cases for next thursday meeting with DBS
Morgan is finishing up the design for the website by wednesday
left with a few mockups
resolution is very poor so needs more time to refine
